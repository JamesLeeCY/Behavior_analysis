# Behavior_analysis
Behavior analysis for ADHDDM LCT paradigm


1.Data preprocessing and merging: ADHDDMDP.R
2.Calculate Acceptance rate (AR) and Reaction time (RT) : AR&RT.R
3.Calculate AR and RT for both group and plotting figure: Mean&Ttest_final.R
4.Caculate Decision threshold (DT) by logistic regression: logistic_regression.R
5.Plotting DT and square DT distribution; AR, and RT figure by group and plotting: Beh_DTAR_0821.R
6.Conduct Anova of AR and RT by group, probability, magnitude: ANOVA.R
### ROI data involved 
7.Plotting the ROI data by Ten EV by group and magnitude: ROI_PLML_TenEV_0906.R (Template for lmer: lmer_ROIwithProb_0823.R)
8.Correlate the ROI data with NPT data: NPT_ROI_PMI_n57_1015.R
